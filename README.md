# Custom clients with @yuuvis/project

This project is an example of how to create a custom yuuvis&reg; client project using [@yuuvis/project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuuvis/project) schematics. It will be a single view where you can search for objects, display the results and see the details for one of the result entries.

It will also show you how to add third-party libraries in order to enhance objects details.

Check out ["Webcast: How to create a custom client with yuuvis&reg; Momentum"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXY6vuDH2b8) on YouTube, where we explain this example step by step.

## Create project using Angular CLI

We assume that you already installed [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

```sh
# create new project using CLI
ng new my-project
```
Make sure to add routing to your application, because we'll use components that rely on the router. For styling choose SCSS.


```sh
# enter project folder
cd my-project

# add @yuuvis/project schematics
ng add @yuuvis/project
```
You will be prompted to add either `core` or `framework` package. Choose `framework`. This will setup and configure your project to use a yuuvis&reg; Momentum backend and specialized UI components from `@yuuvis/framework` library.

## Set up dev proxy
To be able to communicate with a yuuvuis&reg; Momentum backend we need to set up a dev proxy. Open the `proxy` folder from your projects root and rename `_proxy.connections.json` to `proxy.connections.json` by just removing the underscore. Add the connection details for your backend system to the file. Once you renamed the file it is part of the projects `.gitignore` and will not be pushed to your remote repository.

Run `npm run proxy` to spin up your dev proxy.

You may also use the `yuuvis dev proxy` desktop application. Download: [EXE-File](https://files.optimal-systems.org/index.php/s/8G9wfkHPBBkrFHG) or [ZIP archive](https://files.optimal-systems.org/index.php/s/y6MWqxS7oaL9eNx).

Now you can run `npm start` to launch the Angular CLI dev server. Go to [localhost:4400](http://localhost:4400/) to take a look at your app. As long as you don't stop the server, the application will reload everytime you change the code (live reload).

## Create the actual app

Now we set up our app component. Just take a look at the components files to see how this is done. Also checkout `app.module.ts` for module imports.

## Documentation

Within this example application we are using [@yuuvis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuuvis/core) and [@yuuvis/framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuuvis/framework) library. To see what components and services are available from those libraries check out their [documentation](https://yuuvis-cc.yuuvis.org/).

## Conclusion

As you have seen, it takes less than 10 minutes to create a simple yuuvis&reg; client application from scratch when using `@yuuvis/project` schematics. Now it's up to your creativity. Enjoy!
